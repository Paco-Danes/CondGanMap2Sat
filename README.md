# CondGanMap2Sat
Repository for Neural Network project 2023/2024, Ai &amp; Robotics, double Conditional PatchGan for map to satellite view generation.
Student: Francesco Danese, 1926188.
The repository contains 2 files:
* CompleteWorkflow.ipynb : please open this with Google Colab since it is formatted in a way that the cells are grouped in sections with titles for a better code organization and a quicker review. This is basically the whole project work, including: data processing (loading, visualization, augmentation), models architecture, training pipelines, evaluations etc etc. Almost all cells eventual output was mantained and it's still visible. You can press: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Paco-Danes/CondGanMap2Sat/blob/main/CompleteWorkflow.ipynb) 
* NN_project.ipynb / NN_project.pdf: those two files have the same content. I suggest you to open the pdf (converted from the notebook) since the images sometimes causes colab to freeze/crash. This is a short but complete description of the methods and implementations employed in the project. Test results are presented, along with some real examples of the various models' capabilities and generated images.

Note: I'll add before tomorrow (13/02/24) a way to share the model weights and test set, and a notebook where you can test yourself the models and the method and generate the images, with proper instructions.
