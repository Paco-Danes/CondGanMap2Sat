# CondGanMap2Sat
Repository for Neural Network project 2023/2024, Ai &amp; Robotics, double Conditional Gan for map to satellite view generation.
The repository contains 2 files:
* CompleteWorkflow.ipynb : Please open this with Google Colab since it is formatted in a way that the cells are grouped in sections with titles for a better code organization and a quicker review --> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Paco-Danes/CondGanMap2Sat/blob/main/CompleteWorkflow.ipynb) This is basically the whole project work, including: data processing (loading, visualization, augmentation), models architecture, training pipelines, evaluations etc etc. Almost all cells eventual output was mantained and it's still visible.
* NN_project.ipynb / NN_project.pdf: Those two files have the same content. I suggest you to open the pdf (converted from the notebook) since the images sometimes causes colab to freeze/crash. This is a short but complete description of the methods and implementations employed in the project. Test results are presented, along with some real examples of the various models' capabilities and generated images.
