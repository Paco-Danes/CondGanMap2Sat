        "### **Abstract**\n",
        "In this notebook we aim to reproduce and enhance **[StyleAligned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02133)**, a novel technique introduced by **Google Research**, for achieving **Style Consistency** in large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models. While current T2I models excel in creating visually compelling images from textual descriptions, they often struggle to maintain a consistent style across multiple images. Traditional methods to address this require extensive fine-tuning and manual intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "**StyleAligned** addresses this challenge by introducing minimal **Attention Sharing** during the **Diffusion Process**, ensuring **Style Alignment among generated images** without the need for optimization or fine-tuning (**Zero-Shoot Inference**). The method operates by leveraging a straightforward inversion operation to apply a reference style across various generated images, maintaining high-quality synthesis and fidelity to the provided text prompts."

        "The **[Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868)** module is essential for **StyleAligned**. This works by first computing the mean and standard deviation of the input feature tensor $x$, independently for each feature map. The mean $\\mu_x$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_x$ are calculated as: $$\\mu_x = \\frac{1}{HW} \\sum_{i=1}^{H} \\sum_{j=1}^{W} x_{ij}$$ and $$\\sigma_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{HW} \\sum_{i=1}^{H} \\sum_{j=1}^{W} (x_{ij} - \\mu_x)^2 + \\epsilon}$$, where $H$ and $W$ are the height and width of the feature map, respectively, and $\\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability. These statistics are then matched to those of the style features $y$ by normalizing the input features $x$ and then scaling and shifting them using the style's mean $\\mu_y$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_y$.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Set Prompts**:\n",
        "   - We define a set of prompts for generating images. The first prompt refers to the reference image, while the subsequent prompts are used to generate new images.\n",
        "   - The reference style is appended to each of the subsequent prompts to ensure the generated images adhere to the desired style.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Configure Style Alignment Handler**:\n",
        "   - We initialize a handler for the Style Aligned (SA) model and configure it using the `StyleAlignedArgs` parameters. These parameters control various aspects of the style alignment process, such as normalization and attention mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Run Diffusion Inversion**:\n",
        "   - We execute the DDIM inversion process to map the reference image to its latent representation. This inversion allows us to extract latent features that can be used to guide the generation of new images in the desired style.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Generate Images**:\n",
        "   - Using the latent representation obtained from the inversion process, we generate new images based on the defined prompts. We will generate random latent vectors of shape (number_of_prompts, 4, 128, 128) from a normal distribution. We will make use of generator to ensure that the random values are reproducible. In this step, I will have also to ensure that the latent vectors have the same data type as required by the model’s UNet.\n",
        "   After this, we will set the first latent vector to the one extracted from the reference image, ensuring that the first generated image closely adheres to the reference style.\n",
        "   The latent features of the reference image are combined with the prompts to produce images that are stylistically aligned with the reference image.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Display Results**:\n",
        "   - Finally, we display the generated images to visualize the effect of the style alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process demonstrates how to leverage the power of diffusion models and inversion techniques to generate images with consistent and coherent styles, guided by a reference image."
